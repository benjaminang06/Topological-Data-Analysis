Using Topological Data Analysis to Analyze Basketball Data


This thesis explores the application of Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to the University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP) basketball league data, aiming to transcend traditional player classifications and uncover nuanced player subgroups and strategic insights. Amid the evolving landscape of basketball, where players increasingly exhibit skills that blur the lines between traditional positions, this study seeks to employ TDA, particularly the Mapper Algorithm, as a lens through which the complexity of player roles and team dynamics can be more accurately represented.

Our research is guided by three primary questions: (1) the potential of TDA to identify unique player subgroups within the UAAP league, (2) the capability of the Mapper Algorithm to highlight strategic advantages by analyzing the league's player composition, and (3) the nature of distinct player clusters that emerge from this analysis and their implications on understanding player roles and team strategies.

By analyzing the UAAP Season 85 player data, we demonstrate that TDA can indeed reveal significant player subgroups that conventional positional labels fail to capture. The Mapper Algorithm, in particular, provides profound insights into the league's player diversity and strategic compositions, identifying outliers and regions of sparse data that suggest untapped strategic advantages. Our findings reveal distinct clusters of players, each representing unique playing styles and tactical roles that contribute to a deeper comprehension of the strategic underpinnings of the UAAP basketball league.
